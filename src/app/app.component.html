  The above graph plots the 'valence' of the songs in your recent listening history. <br>

   Valence is a measure of the overall 'mood' of a song. <br>
  Tracks with high valence sound more positive (happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (sad, depressed, angry).<br>
  Valence is computed through machine learning: an algorithm was trained on a set of songs that were particularly happy or sad, and then resulting
  knowledge was applied to assess the mood of other songs in the Spotify library.
