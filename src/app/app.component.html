  <ul>
    <li>
      Valence describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (happy, cheerful, euphoric),
      while tracks with low valence sound more negative (sad, depressed, angry).

    	Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
      A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

    	Energy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
